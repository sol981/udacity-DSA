## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
- Because it needs go traver every folder in path, need use recursion
- check path is folder of file
- The suffix of the files to be found ?

## Time Efficiency:
The time complexity of find_files is O(n) in the worst case, but it can be closer to O(n log n) in practice.

## Space Efficiency:
The space complexity is O(d) in the worst case, where d is the maximum depth of the directory tree.
